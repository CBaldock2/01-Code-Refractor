# 01-Code-Refractor

## Description
I added code to this project to give the webpage a title. I also shortened the CSS by combining a few class element because the elements had the same styling. My motivation was to clean the code up and by shortening the CSS the code no longer repeats itself, making it look nicer. I solved the issue of when clicking the "Search Engine Optimization" button nothing would happen. Now when clicking the button it takes you to the SEO section of the page. I learned to always save and save again to make sure your updated files will add to the repo. I also looked up more HTML element tags to further understand what they are and when to use them.
